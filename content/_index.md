Welcome to the Noodler docs. If you are new here, we would reccomend starting in this order:

1. [Getting Started](/getting-started) - This page will give you a high-level overview of Noolder.
2. [Self-Hosting](/self-hosting) - In a few simple steps, you will have your own instance running. 
3. [Install the SDK](/getting-started/install-sdk/) - Learn how to send data to the instance.
